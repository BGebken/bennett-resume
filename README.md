# Bootstrap Resume Project
This is a personal fork of the Start Bootstrap project, under the MIT license which is a a resume and CV theme. This theme features a fixed sidebar with content sections to build a simple, yet elegant resume. I am using it to publish my own resume while also exploring the creation of a CI/CD approach to integrate testing and deployment 

## [Live Resume Here](https://Bennett.gebken.io)

I am still planning further features in the future, such as traffic monitoring and the ability to download a copy of my more detailed resume. I may also use this site to demo more projects as I add interesting things to my portfolio!

## Usage
From CLI:
Run `npm install` and then run `npm start` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. 
You can view the `package.json` file to see which scripts are included.

#### npm Scripts
- `npm run build` builds the project - this builds assets, HTML, JS, and CSS into `dist`
- `npm run build:assets` copies the files in the `src/assets/` directory into `dist`
- `npm run build:pug` compiles the Pug located in the `src/pug/` directory into `dist`
- `npm run build:scripts` brings the `src/js/scripts.js` file into `dist`
- `npm run build:scss` compiles the SCSS files located in the `src/scss/` directory into `dist`
- `npm run clean` deletes the `dist` directory to prepare for rebuilding the project
- `npm run start:debug` runs the project in debug mode
- `npm start` or `npm run start` runs the project, launches a live preview in your default browser, and watches for changes made to files in `src`
