# Bootstrap Resume Project
This is a personal fork of the Start Bootstrap project, under the MIT license which is a a resume and CV theme. This theme features a fixed sidebar with content sections to build a simple, yet elegant resume. I am using it to publish my own resume while also exploring the creation of a CI/CD approach to integrate testing and deployment

I am still planning further features in the future, such as traffic monitoring and the ability to download a copy of my more detailed resume. I may also use this site to demo more projects as I add interesting things to my portfolio!
